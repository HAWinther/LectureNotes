# LectureNotes
Random lecture notes.

The folder [ICG\_PhD\_Lectures\_Theoretical\_Cosmology\_2016](ICG_PhD_Lectures_Theoretical_Cosmology_2016) contains lecture notes and slides for the PhD lectures on theoretical cosmology in 2016. These are written by Kazuya Koyama, Vincent Vennin and David Wands.

The 2017 and 2018 lectures on theoretical cosmology were given by Hans Winther, Emir Gumrukcuoglu and Matteo Fasiello.
Emir's dark energy lectures are in [darkenergy1-1-AEG.pdf](darkenergy1-1-AEG.pdf) and [darkenergy1-2-AEG.pdf](darkenergy1-2-AEG.pdf).
My lectures on theoretical cosmology are found in [Theoretical\_Cosmology_Lecture\_1.pdf](Theoretical_Cosmology_Lecture_1.pdf) (introduction to theoretical cosmology) and [Theoretical\_Cosmolog\y_Lecture\_2.pdf](Theoretical_Cosmology_Lecture_2.pdf) (the big bang model and the theremal history of the Universe)
