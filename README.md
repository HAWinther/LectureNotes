The folder [ICG\_PhD\_Lectures\_Theoretical\_Cosmology\_2016] contains lecture notes and slides for the PhD lectures on theoretical cosmology in 2016. These are written by Kazuya Koyama, Vincent Vennine and David Wands.

The 2017 and 2018 lectures on theoretical cosmology were given by Hans Winther, Emir Gumrukcuoglu and Matteo Fasiello.
Emir's dark energy lectures are in [darkenergy1-1-AEG.pdf] and [darkenergy1-2-AEG.pdf].
